			<h2>Early Life and Education</h2>
			<p>Subhash Chandra Bose was born on January 23, 1897 in Cuttack, Orissa. He was the ninth child of Prabhavati Dutt Bose and Janakinath Bose. Bose completed his education in England and earned a degree in Civil Service. However, he was not interested in a career in the British civil service and instead returned to India in 1921 to participate in the Indian independence movement.</p>

			<h2>Role in Indian Independence Movement</h2>
			<p>Bose joined the Indian National Congress and quickly rose to a prominent leadership position. He was elected president of the Indian National Congress in 1938 and 1939, but resigned from the party in 1939 due to differences with other leaders. Bose then formed the Forward Bloc in 1939, which aimed to unite all left-wing elements in the Congress and other parties.</p>

			<h2>Formation of the Indian National Army</h2>
			<p>During World War II, Bose sought support from Axis powers to help gain India's independence from British rule. He formed the Indian National Army (INA) in 1942 with the help of Japanese forces. The INA fought alongside Japanese forces in Burma and India, but was eventually defeated. Bose died in a plane crash in August 1945, under disputed circumstances.</p>

			<h2>Legacy</h2>
			<p>Subhash Chandra Bose is remembered for his contributions to the Indian independence movement and for his leadership of the Indian National Army. He is also remembered for his famous slogan, "Jai Hind," which became a rallying cry for the Indian independence movement. Bose is widely regarded as a national hero in India, and his birthday is celebrated as a national holiday in the state of West Bengal.</p>

			<h2>Additional Information</h2>
			<p>Bose was a strong advocate for women's rights and believed that women had an important role to play in the Indian independence movement. He established the All India Women's Conference in 1936 to help advance the cause of women's rights in India. Bose was also a prolific writer and authored several books, including "The Indian Struggle" and "An Indian Pilgrim."</p>
